        <h1>Hi, I'm Josh Anthony</h1>
        <p>I'm a web developer living in beautiful, snowy Rochester, Minnesota with my wife Rebecca and my son Kjaerlighet.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="copy c2">
        <h2>I write code and develop web applications.</h2>
        <p>My expertise is putting together web apps using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, or CSS (often using two or more of these in conjunction, depending on the needs of the project at hand).</p>
        <p>Programming with Bigcommerce is another major part of my work background, and I have turned multiple Bigcommerce sites into gleaming ecommerce platforms. Additionally, I've had some experience in working with Hubspot.</p>
        <p>As for frameworks, Laravel is my preference, but not the only one I'm willing to work with.</p>
        <p>My prefered forms of work fuel include coffee and Monster energy drinks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="copy c3">
        <h2>I possess several years worth of web experience.</h2>
        <p>I've done just about everything, from developing web applications, to augmenting existing websites, to completely rebuilding company websites.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm the web programmer for Pace International, the distributor powering the successful DISH Network pay-as-you-go satellite platform, DISHForMyRV.</p>
        <p>Previously, I was the lead web developer for Schoolizon, a startup reseller dedicated to improving the school supply purchasing process.</p>

      <div class="copy c4">
        <h2>I do more than convert caffeine into code.</h2>
        <p>I love to read; I make a point of spending some time each week with my nose in a book. In this age of technological omnipresence, there's still nothing quite like ink on a page to captivate one's imagination.</p>
        <p>I also have fun shredding my electric guitar, and I enjoy writing computer-generated music (for both personal and commercial use).</p>
        <p>When I'm not working on my latest side project or creative endeavor, I'm kicking back with a more relaxing hobby, such as critiquing Christopher Nolan movies, or playing video games.</p>
        <p>In addition to all the things I love to do, I also cherish the time I get to spend in my offline roles as husband and father.</p>
